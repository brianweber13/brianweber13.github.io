# Work Samples
## BYU prereq crawler
At my former university, many departments would offer flowcharts for majors that showed the order in which courses needed to be taken. However useful these charts were, they were often horribly outdated. For a given list of classes, this app automatically determines what prerequisites each course has along with the courses that are made available upon completing that course.

## myCTL

During the year of 2017, I was employed by Brigham Young University at the CTL (Center for Teaching and Learning) to write websites that assisted the HR department in managing employees. I entered the team after the project had already been published, but I helped extend the website for other departments to use. I worked on writing both backend and frontend components. Unfortunately, the code was quite messy, and I spent much of my time refactoring and cleaning up code, in addition to writing new features. I am not allowed to share the full source code for anything I produced at that job, but I am allowed to share screenshots of the website along with screenshots of key commit diffs I wrote. Following are some major contributions I made.

### Extending Hire and Termination Capabilities

Soon after I was hired, we began extending the HR tools to work with another departments, the Testing Center (TC). Because this department's requirements were much different than those at the CTL, we had to entirely rewrite the hire and termination modules in our app. I spearheaded this effort and wrote the majority of the code for both hire and termination functionality.

Unfortunately, releasing commit diffs for this work would require me to reveal the large parts of source code, which I have been asked not to do by my previous employer.

Transitioning from paper processes to our web application would have required the person in charge of hiring to enter every employee's information manually. In order to facilitate this process, I created a page where employees could hire themselves, effectively crowdsourcing this work. This page required the user to log in and then only allowed them to add information about themself.

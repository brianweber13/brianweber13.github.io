    "description": "This project is an implementation of Craig Reynolds's \" Boids\" program written in plain Javascript and WebGL. Weber created this for a computer graphics class, working from the ground up with no API to work with. Even much of the linear algebra was written by her! Weber was able to use much of her skill in high-performance computing by optimizing away unnecessary copies in array addition and implementing a 3D grid system so that boids only look for neighbors among neighboring cells. This project prevent several challenges, like trying to squeeze a reasonable amount of performance out of Javascript math. Additionally, tuning parameters ended up being incredibly difficult. In the future, Weber would like to explore WebGL compute shaders to speed up the distance calculation and improve performance. You can play with this program yourself by clicking <a href='https://paigeweber13.github.io/boids-webgl/'> here</a>."

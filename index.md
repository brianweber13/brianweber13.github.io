# Bio
I am a computer science student at the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte with an emphasis in computer systems. My passions include classical
computer science theory, computability, parallel computing, and backend
development. I have experience working as a web developer, writing and
classifying algorithms, implementing data structures, and parallelizing code. I
have used C++ extensively in classroom settings and also have industry
experience with Javascript, php, and mySQL. Currently I am interested in
learning more about data science and programming closer to bare metal. In my
spare time I fly model airplanes, listen to music, and 3D print new gadgets.

## Photos By Hipster
During the year of 2017, I ran a small photography business. Using WordPress, I created [photosbyhipster.com](http://photosbyhipster.com/) in order to have a portfolio to present to potential clients.

## BYU Flowchart Tool
At my former university, many departments would offer flowcharts for majors
that showed the order in which courses needed to be taken. However useful these
charts were, they were often horribly outdated. For a given list of classes,
this app automatically determines what prerequisites each course has along with
the courses that are made available upon completing that course. Scrapes
official BYU course catalog for information and generates a table. [Click

## myCTL
![myCTL Home Page](/resources/site - Home Page.png)

During the year of 2017, I was employed by Brigham Young University at the CTL (Center for Teaching and Learning) to write websites that assisted the HR department in managing employees. I entered the team after the project had already been published, but I helped extend the website for other departments to use. I worked on writing both backend and frontend components. Unfortunately, the code was quite messy, and I spent much of my time refactoring and cleaning up code, in addition to writing new features. I am not allowed to share the full source code for anything I produced at that job, but I am allowed to share screenshots of the website along with screenshots of key commit diffs I wrote. Following are some major contributions I made.

### Extending Hire and Termination Capabilities
![TC Hire Page](/resources/site - new employee form.png)

Soon after I was hired, we began extending the HR tools to work with another department, the Testing Center (TC). Because this department's requirements were much different than those at the CTL, we had to entirely rewrite the hire and termination modules in our app. I spearheaded this effort and wrote the majority of the code for both hire and termination functionality.

Unfortunately, releasing commit diffs for this work would require me to reveal the large parts of source code, which I have been asked not to do by my previous employer.

Transitioning from paper processes to our web application would have required the person in charge of hiring to enter every employee's information manually. In order to facilitate this process, I created a page where employees could hire themselves, thereby crowdsourcing this work. This page required the user to log in and then only allowed them to add information about themself.

### Improving Image Upload Script
After publishing the improved hiring capabilities of our website, I discovered that the php script that handled file uploads only supported images of one aspect ratio. The people who had originally written the website had designed the php script so that it only handled images taken by a specific camera, as the HR department only used one camera for employee pictures up to that point. However, the Testing Center uploaded square pictures that got stretched by the php script. I made some changes so that the original aspect ratio of the image was preserved. [Here](/resources/code - preserve aspect ratio now.png) you can see the commit where I wrote the function 'resizeWithOriginalAspectRatio' that was used to handle the square images much more gracefully. [In this screenshot,](/resources/code - making upload_files handle transparency and stuff.png) you can see my final commit before my branch was merged. I made many small changes, such as converting all the images to jpg before saving them on our server. When this script was published, it handled jpeg, png, and gif images.

### Semester Count Hotfix
At the Testing Center, employee seniority is determined by the number of fall
or winter semesters the employee has worked, and the more senior an employee
is, the earlier they will be able to register for shifts. This was done so that
those who have worked the longest have first choice of shifts. The day before
registration was to open for new employees at the testing center, we discovered
that the function that counted the number of semesters an employee has worked
included spring and summer terms in its count, instead of only counting fall
and winter semesters. The employee designated to make this change had to leave
work before finding the bug, so I took over. In less than one hour, I
discovered the bug, wrote a fix, and published it to our live website. Turns
out whoever had written the code to count semesters had not written any code to
differentiate between Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer semesters. What an
oversight! My fix can be viewed [here](/resources/code - count semesters
worked.png).

# Current Work
The following repositories are currently my most active:
- [exercism-progress](https://github.com/rileyweber13/exercism-progress): I am
  currently working through the python and c++ tracks on exercism to improve my
  comfort with rapidly solving problems as I would in a technical interview.
- [handwritten-digit-recognition](https://github.com/rileyweber13/handwritten-digit-recognition):
  Here I am making my first foray into data science and machine learning! I
  hope to use this as a jumping off point to learn more about genetic
  algorithms, neural networks, and automation of mundane daily tasks.
- [linux-distro-stats](https://github.com/rileyweber13/linux-distro-stats):
  This project is currently on the backend but will serve as a real-world
  problem where I can apply the data science skills I learn in a "full-stack"
  project. I plan on visualizing data scraped from distrowatch and I hope to
  find a way to apply machine learning to create a predictive model. Maybe I
  can try to teach a computer to predict a review score based on the content of
  the review?
